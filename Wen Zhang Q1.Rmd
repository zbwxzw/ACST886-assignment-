### Q1

The loan amount is 600000, $i=3.5%$, $n=30$, $v=1/(1+i)$.
Loan amount is equal to the present value at the outset of the repayments.
The yearly repayment is x where
$600000 = x*(1+v^1+v^2+...+v^30) = x*(1-v^n)/i$
Using uniroot function, the annual repayment is $32622.8

```{r}
i=.035; n=30; v=1/(1+i)
f1<-function(x) {600000-x*(1-(1/(1+i))^n)/i}
x <- uniroot(f1,c(30000,40000), tol=0.0001)
x$root
```
